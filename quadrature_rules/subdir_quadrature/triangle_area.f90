subroutine triangle_area ( node_xy, area )

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! TRIANGLE_AREA computes the area of a triangle.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    If the triangle's vertices are given in counterclockwise order,
!    the area will be positive.  If the triangle's vertices are given
!    in clockwise order, the area will be negative!
!
!    If you cannot guarantee counterclockwise order, and you need to
!    have the area positive, then you can simply take the absolute value
!    of the result of this routine.
!
!    An earlier version of this routine always returned the absolute
!    value of the computed area.  I am convinced now that that is
!    a less useful result!  For instance, by returning the signed
!    area of a triangle, it is possible to easily compute the area
!    of a nonconvex polygon as the sum of the (possibly negative)
!    areas of triangles formed by node 1 and successive pairs of vertices.
