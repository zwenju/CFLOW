subroutine reference_to_physical_t3 ( node_xy, n, ref, phy )

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! REFERENCE_TO_PHYSICAL_T3 maps T3 reference points to physical points.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    Given the vertices of an order 3 physical triangle and a point
!    (XSI,ETA) in the reference triangle, the routine computes the value
!    of the corresponding image point (X,Y) in physical space.
!
!    This routine is also appropriate for an order 4 triangle,
!    as long as the fourth node is the centroid of the triangle.
!
!    This routine may also be appropriate for an order 6
!    triangle, if the mapping between reference and physical space
!    is linear.  This implies, in particular, that the sides of the
!    image triangle are straight and that the "midside" nodes in the
!    physical triangle are literally halfway along the sides of
!    the physical triangle.

!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) NODE_XY(2,3), the coordinates of the vertices.
!    The vertices are assumed to be the images of (0,0), (1,0) and
!    (0,1) respectively.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) N, the number of objects to transform.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) REF(2,N), points in the reference triangle.
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) PHY(2,N), corresponding points in the
!    physical triangle.
