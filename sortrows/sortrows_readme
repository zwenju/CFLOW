This codes call the qsort_r/qsort functions to do the matrix sorts based on the rows

********************************************************************************
i4 represents the int for C/C++ and integer(kind=4) for fortran 
1:
i4_sortrows.c  is the same as the matlab sortrows
the rows are sorted based on the entities from lift to right 

2:
i4_unique_sortrows.c  is the same as the matlab sortrows and unique functions
the rows are sorted based on the entities from left to right
only return the unique rows from top to bottom,  the bottom parts are assigned to be zeros 



3:
i4_sortrows_reverse.c  is the same as the matlab sortrows
the rows are sorted based on the entities from right to left

4:
i4_unique_sortrows_reverse.c  is the same as the matlab sortrows and unique functions
the rows are sorted based on the entities from right to left
only return the unique rows from top to bottom,  the bottom parts are assigned to be zeros
